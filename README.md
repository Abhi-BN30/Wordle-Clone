# Wordle-Clone
A 1,2 player wordle game built using Python consisting of pygame and getpass

The single player wordle has a fully functional GUI and works the same as the official wordle page where the players are given a limited number of guesses to identify the word.
The 2 play wordle is built only for the terminal functioning where the users are allowed to input their names respectively and both of them have to give their secret word which has to be guessed by the other user.
Run the code accordingly for a better understanding.
